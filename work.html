                <h1>My website</h1>
                <img src="img/website.png">
                <p>Creation time of this website & portfolio: Total 5 days</p>
                    <p>
                    What I would like to express the most on this website is
                    "Development into new me". <br>
                    I created this website to imagine when I stand on my own feet 
                    after graduating from university.<br>
                    As description of the website, 
                    I chose the colour of white, gray and rose gold, 
                    and the sophisticated font for the website 
                    because I'm trying to change myself to a mature woman. <br>
                    Also, by integrating the colours and making margin on the edges, 
                    people can absorb the information and read pages easily.<br>
                    I would be glad if you visit my website from the link below 
                    after you read this page.</p>

                        <p>The header shows you activities I'm going to start or improve, 
                            such as travelling, blogging and photographing. <br>
                            However, now it doesn't appear because I'm making it better, 
                            so please look forward to it. <br>
                            Also, in the future, 
                            I'm planning to start my business on "Shop".<br>
                            By the way, as a main content, I put a photo of me 
                            around cherry blossoms on the left and Instagram and YouTube 
                            that I've been doing for over a year on the right. <br>

                        <p>On the bottom, I put travel photos that I took in some countries. <br>
                            I chose the best photos of each country and when you point it, 
                            the name of countries will be shown and move to another page 
                            when you click.<br>
                            Those photos are applied a filter on Lightroom app.</p>

                        <p>I created a page of UK photos so far because it is my most favourite country.<br>
                            So, you can come to this page when you click the UK area on the above photo.<br>
                            There're the name of country and a large photo on the top of this page.</p>
